SVO_Tesing

Tesing SVO algorithm with agent-based simulation and evolutionary search

This is the code for paper "Safety Validation of Sense and Avoid Algorithms Using Simulation and Evolutionary Search"

To use the code, you need the following dependencies: SVO_Java: https://github.com/superxueyizou/SVO_Java.git, Java implementation of Selective Velocity Obstacle (SVO); MASON: http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/, an agent-based simulation framework; ECJ:http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/, an evolutionary search system in Java.
